        With a degree in Fashion Design, Ana Wang started her multidisciplinary career working in lingerie, bridal and then childrenswear. As the world shifted from being centered around the physical to a  digital reality, she went on to work in content and new media to move ideas forward and build mainstream appeal in the fields of sustainability, entrepreneurship and education, independently as a blogger and publisher as well as at companies such as Shopify and SuperHi. Through her move from creative production to working for technology companies, she's maintained a mind for the macro, trend forecasting and organizing information, and plays with systems, the methodology of transformation and the management of knowledge across fields.
