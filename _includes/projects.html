        </div>
        <p>2020, the year where many of us discovered new hobbies...myself, included. I've been a digital creator for two decades now and have yearned to find something to ground me in a more tangible and physical reality through the senses. During the pandemic, when every day felt like an endless onslaught of screentime, I started experimenting with fragrance and candles. The combination of art and science, of intuition and methodology, became an act of self care and creative escape. After months of testing, I released 2 scents: Sunny Side Up, and Moonshot, which will be available for purchase soon, with a portion of the cost of each candle going to support technology and reading initiatives for children. Made with: Soy/coconut wax.</p>

            <div class="work-top-right">Newsletter</div>
        </div>
        <p>Bread is a newsletter about creative breadth, each one an essay about a specific influence spanning fashion, technology, business, science, and culture. I started this project in 2020 as a creative exercise to try to write more of what I wanted to read myself: introspective, (hopefully) entertaining, long-form content that combines fragments of narrative nonfiction with research and education. Unlike many of my other projects, this one is more personal; as I felt like I was at a crossroads in my career, it was meant to be an ongoing journey into learning more about myself and what influences me as a multidisciplinary creative, like a mood board in writing. I made it public because a) it forced me to write and research better, as that was one of my goals and b) I think it's a worthwhile exercise for anyone to examine what influences them, as a way to reflect on values and direction. We are what we eat, see, experience, hate, love, etc. Below are some of my favorite issues so far. Made with: Substack, Figma.</p>

<p>I was the lead operator at a small startup from 2013-2015 focused on celebrating independent retail and providing convenient, digital-driven ways for designers/brands and boutiques to connect without sales agents. I developed growth strategies and initiatives including #worldsbiggestshophop and interviewing over 500 of the most important and acclaimed boutique owners in North America, implementing a city-by-city rollout strategy. The startup was profitable within 2 weeks of launch. Made with: Wordpress, Google Sheets.</p>

<p>In 2011, I started a small fashion label focused on exploring essentiality in clothing as a concept, beyond basics. The line was featured in various media online and in print.</p>
    
<p>  "The result is a classic, fitted button-down that looks great tucked, untucked, and even tied up in the front. The well-executed basic led to a couple more pieces, and by March of this year, she had her first capsule collection, which included a belt-optional mini with loose three-quarter cuffed sleeves. This understated chic design turned out to be a favourite among customers. So naturally when Wang launched her silk collection, she included the Parker Silk Shirtdress, which is essentially the same design in a different fabric and comes in five colours: black, bone, petal, evergreen, and a gorgeous eye-popping fuchsia.</p>

    <p> Another understated highlight from this collection‚Äîwhich she sells exclusively through her website‚Äîis her machine-washable, super-simple, slightly flared silk tank that skims the body in a loose, unassuming way‚Äîagain, fresh and modern, but trend-proof." -Georgia Straight</p>

            <p>PTL (petal, essentially) has been a work-in-progress for almost a decade. As a side project aficiando and insatiable creative, I've used PTL as the banner for multiple projects and retail products I've created over the years, including a vintage loungewear shop in 2018 and a beauty oil shop in 2016. In 2021, I rebuilt the store from scratch on Shopify after learning to code. This will be an online store to act as the space for all my retail projects and ecommerce experiments going forward.

            <p>I was the first ever Head of Content at SuperHi, a creative education company teaching design, code and project management online. As the startup was starting to move beyond its foundations as a code school, I helped to shape brand voice across the marketing site and various brand touchpoints (blog, student experience, internal onboarding, social media), and led our content marketing strategy, writing over 20 long-form posts and lead generation guides on soft skills, project management, design and careers to expand our student base, increase organic reach and cement SuperHi's value proposition in the increasingly competitive edtech space. The CEO of a competitor once reached out and called our blog the "best design content on the internet". </p>

            <p>Inspired by the dedicated communities built around user-submitted and voted discovery websites such as Reddit and Product Hunt, Wonder Machine was conceptualized as a media-agnostic, user-submitted discovery engine for things to read on the internet. Like many people, I'm a big consumer of content but have found myself disenchanted by most of it, addicted to rabbitholes that are neither inspiring, interesting or engaging. Wonder Machine focuses primarily on long form and interactive content and celebrates the creators and collaborators it takes to make outstanding content on the internet, from writers and designers to developers and data scientists. The website is built with a user signup and submission process with popularity aggregated based on unique user votes. Made with: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby on Rails. </p>

The Good Closet was featured in multiple media outlets including Vogue in their 2017 Galentine's Day shopping feature. </p>
