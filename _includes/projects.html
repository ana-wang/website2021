        <p>2020, the year where many of us discovered new hobbies...myself, included. I've been a digital creator for two decades now and have yearned to find something to ground me in a more tangible and physical reality through the senses. During the pandemic, when every day felt like an endless onslaught of screentime, I started experimenting with fragrance and candles. The combination of art and science, of intuition and methodology, became an act of self care and creative escape. After months of testing, I released 2 scents: Sunny Side Up, and Moonshot, which will be available for purchase soon, with 20% of the cost of each candle going to support technology and reading initiatives for children. Made with: Soy/coconut wax.</p>

        <p>Bread is a newsletter about creative breadth, each one an essay about a specific influence spanning fashion, technology, business, science, and culture. I started this project in 2020 as a creative exercise to try to write more of what I wanted to read myself: introspective, (hopefully) entertaining, long-form content that combines fragments of narrative nonfiction with research and education. Unlike many of my other projects, this one is more personal; as I felt like I was at a crossroads in my career, it was meant to be an ongoing journey into learning more about myself and what influences me as a multidisciplinary creative, like a mood board in writing. I made it public because a) it forced me to write and research better, as that was one of my goals and b) I think it's a worthwhile exercise for anyone to examine what influences them, as a way to reflect on values and direction. We are what we eat, see, experience, hate, love, etc. Below are some of my favorite issues so far. Made with: Substack, Figma.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Inspired by the dedicated communities built around user-submitted and voted discovery websites such as Reddit and Product Hunt, Wonder Machine was conceptualized as a media-agnostic, user-submitted discovery engine for things to read on the internet. Like many people, I'm a big consumer of content but have found myself disenchanted by most of it, addicted to rabbitholes that are neither inspiring, interesting or engaging. Wonder Machine focuses primarily on long form and interactive content and celebrates the creators and collaborators it takes to make outstanding content on the internet, from writers and designers to developers and data scientists. The website is built with a user signup and submission process with popularity aggregated based on unique user votes. Made with: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby on Rails. </p>

            <p>An ongoing theme of my personal research and writing is reinvention, so I've put together some resources for anyone to access, things I've read and seen that have inspired me to be not just the inventor of my own career and life, but to believe in my power and agency to do it again and again. I search far and wide to bring in context and reference from pop culture, history, and art but this is written for anyone. Made with: Jekyll, Liquid, HTML, CSS, Javascript.</p>

            <p>PTL (petal, essentially) has been a work-in-progress for almost a decade. As a side project aficiando and insatiable creative, I've used PTL as the banner for multiple projects and retail products I've created over the years, including a vintage loungewear shop in 2018 and a beauty oil shop in 2016. In 2021, I rebuilt the store from scratch on Shopify after learning to code. This will be an online store to act as the space for all my retail projects and ecommerce experiments going forward.  Made with: Shopify, Liquid, HTML/CSS, Javascript.</p>

            <p>I was the first ever Head of Content at SuperHi, a creative education company teaching design, code and project management online. As the startup was starting to move beyond its foundations as a code school, I helped to shape brand voice across the marketing site and various brand touchpoints (blog, student experience, internal onboarding, social media), and led our content marketing strategy, writing over 20 long-form posts and lead generation guides on soft skills, project management, design and careers to expand our student base, increase organic reach and cement SuperHi's value proposition in the increasingly competitive edtech space. The CEO of a competitor once reached out and called our blog the "best design content on the internet". </p>
