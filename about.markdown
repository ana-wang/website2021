<h1>Where imagination meets designed reality</h1>

Hi, I'm Ana. I'm the founder of PTL, a Vancouver-based research and content studio focused on emerging technology and storytelling. Current projects include a couple of tiny publications.

Playing with perception, education and metaphor, I produce cross-platform, cross-discipline content that uses aesthetics, the cultural zeitgeist and universalities of the human experience to push for personal and macro transformation. I do this mostly in "soft" and frivolous fields such as fashion, beauty, entertainment and gaming, areas that people typically use as a form of escape and indulgence.

My work, both visually and strategically, highlights and celebrates contrast: between soft and hard, art and technology, optimism and reality, the engineered and the imagined, the deep long form and tiny wonderful things. 

I was trained as a fashion designer but ended up spending most of my career (so far) as a writer and operator, working in between communicating ideas and building them. Over the past decade, I've created media entities, was featured on trend forecasting platforms, won accolades across the internet, and built brands and teams in retail, fashion and tech. Most of all, I've failed a lot, and built a career harnessing the nature of the internet and its ephemerality.

My work has been featured in Huffington Post, Forbes, .
