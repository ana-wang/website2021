<h1>Hello this is some intro text</h1>

<p>This is some stuff about Ana Wang.</p>

Hi, I'm Brie. I'm the founder and CEO of TRU LUV, a Toronto-based AI company changing our relationship with technology. We make emotionally conscious AI for refuge, resilience and transformation. Our companions are not personal assistants, nor apps nor games, but a new category of human-computer interaction that feels like friendship. TRU LUV was Canada’s first startup to attend Apple Entrepreneur Camp in 2020 and TRU LUV’s first experimental companion, #SelfCare, was one of Apple’s Best of 2018 Trends of the Year selections. 

With TRU LUV, I’ve also been sharing my love and creative energy with our dear friends at Rare contributing to their magical project Everwild. 

I journal on this website about magical consciousness, digital ritual, emotionally conscious AI, diverse and equitable teams, conscious leadership, developmental organizations and other topics that interest me.

I spent 2015-2020 ___

Previously, I was a lead AI programmer at Ubisoft on the soft, ethereal game Child of Light and three Assassin's Creed games and an AI programmer at Relic Entertainment. I've worked with teams of up to 60 AI developers. 

I'm on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn. I've been featured in publications such as The BBC, The Guardian, Mercedes Benz Magazine, The Huffington Post, and VentureBeat.
