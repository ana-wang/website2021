<h1>Where imagination meets transformation</h1>


Hello world, I'm Ana. I'm the founder of PTL, a Vancouver-based content studio focused on emerging technology and storytelling. 

I research, experiment with and produce content and projects in "soft" industries used for entertainment, escape and indulgence. 








<h1>...</h1>

I produce cross-platform, cross-discipline content that uses aesthetics, the cultural zeitgeist and universalities of the human experience to push for personal and macro transformation. 

Using existing systems of consumption — social media, fashion, games, entertainment — my vision is to introduce and connect people to ideas in ways that are more conducive to reception, action and ultimately, change.

I've previously done this with brands and projects to scale ideas in sustainability, entrepreneurship and education. 

I was trained as a fashion designer but ended up spending most of my career (so far) as a writer and operator, working in between communicating ideas and building them. Over the past decade, I've created media entities, was featured on trend forecasting platforms, and built brands and teams in retail, fashion and tech using social media and content. I've done this independently as well as at companies such as Shopify and SuperHi. 

My work, both visually and strategically, highlights and celebrates contrast: between soft and hard, art and technology, optimism and reality, the engineered and the imagined, the deep long form and tiny wonderful things. Growing up in between mountains and ocean during the rise of the internet and democratized media, a core theme of my practice is observing and emphasizing the commonalities between nature and the universe x human-made artificialities and technology, most centrally the ephemeral nature of everything. 

I've been featured in Huffington Post, Forbes, the Vancouver Sun, Georgia Straight, and I've also been a top writer on Medium.
