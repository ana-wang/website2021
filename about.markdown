<h1>Where imagination meets transformation</h1>


Hello world, I'm Ana. I'm the founder of PTL, a Vancouver-based content studio focused on emerging technology and storytelling. 

I research, experiment with and produce content and projects in "soft" industries known for entertainment, escape and indulgence. 








<h1>...</h1>

Today, almost everything is content, and my particular version of it combines aesthetics, the cultural zeitgeist and universalities of the human experience to push for personal and macro transformation. 

Using existing systems of consumption — social media, fashion, games, entertainment — my vision is to introduce and connect people to ideas about themselves and the world around them, that are more conducive to discoverability, action and ultimately, change.

I've previously done this with brands and projects to scale ideas on sustainability, entrepreneurship and education. 

My work, both visually and strategically, highlights and celebrates contrast: between soft and hard, art and technology, optimism and reality, the engineered and the imagined, the deep long form and tiny wonderful things. Growing up in between mountains and ocean during the rise of the internet and democratized media, a core theme of my practice is observing and emphasizing the commonalities between nature and the universe x human-made artificialities and technology, most centrally the ephemeral nature of everything. 

I was trained as a fashion designer but ended up spending most of my career (so far) as a writer and operator, working in between communicating ideas and building them. From 2015-2020, I built brands and teams in retail, media, fashion and tech, with a focus on content and social media. I've done this independently as well as at companies such as Shopify and SuperHi. Before that, I was a copywriter and designer for startup fashion and ecommerce companies, and helped several brands "get on the internet" for the very first time. It all started with a now long-defunct blog I started when I was a student, called Fashion 2.0. And it continues as I move forward today, focusing on new projects, stories and technologies to build the world I imagine in new and novel ways, one tiny thing at a time.

My past work has been featured in Huffington Post, Forbes, the Vancouver Sun, Georgia Straight, and I've also been a top writer on Medium.
