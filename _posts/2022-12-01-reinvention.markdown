<div class="guide-intro"><p>I think you can do almost anything you want to (certainly not everything and not anything anytime, but probably more than you think)...but do you think you can? After I left my job in content marketing at the end of 2020, I asked myself: if I could create one last piece of content, what would it be? What information do I feel is most important for me to share with other people, if I were never to put out another piece of content ever again?</p>
<p>This is it, maybe the most comprehensive catalog on the internet all about personal reinvention (or ongoing self-invention). I've been dreaming, researching and thinking about this topic for years, and I want to share all my resources so that whoever you are, wherever you come from, at whatever point you are in your life, you may find something useful to make your own personal big, grand change. </p></div>

    <h1>Reinvention is always possible</h1>

<p>This section is all about inspiration. As a kid, I went through libraries searching for examples and stories of self-invention. One thing I really wanted to know: are they any different from the rest of us? Is it possible for everyone? I think there's a certain degree of imagination and maybe some low-key egoism involved: you have to believe that you're special. But the thing is, you can trick yourself into thinking you're special and in that way, it's like the chicken or egg scenario. It's hard to tell what came first: if the self belief did or the indication that the self-belief was put in the right place. The thing is, either way, you can't do it without that self belief. Self belief doesn't mean a total lack of self doubt.   </p>

In addition to Over the Moon’s cultural references, several easter eggs nod to China’s space program, the China National Space Administration (CNSA) throughout the film. China’s lunar rover, aptly named Chang’e 4, makes a special appearance when Fei Fei (spoiler alert) lands on the far side of the Moon. Chang’e 4 was preceded by Chang’e 1, 2, and 3 — with number 5 happening right now.
