I'm not a professional developer or a software engineer. I think of learning to code like learning a language. No, I don't believe that everyone needs to learn to code. But, coding is like learning Photoshop or even .. It's a creative skill that can help you create on the internet. That used to be a niche skill, something that only a very small proportion of the population needed to know how to do. But, the internet has taken us to far away places we could've never imagined

With code, you can build websites. You can make games. You can make apps.
