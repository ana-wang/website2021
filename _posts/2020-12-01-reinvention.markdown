I love watching movies. I don't have a favorite genre. For a while, it was sci-fi, until I met someone who was really into sci-fi, and then I realized that I wasn't. And then I thought maybe it was the romantic comedy, but that's not quite right either. Most of them are bad. But one movie that I love and have watched over and over again is Legally Blonde.

Here's a description and intro essay bit. In addition to Over the Moon’s cultural references, several easter eggs nod to China’s space program, the China National Space Administration (CNSA) throughout the film. China’s lunar rover, aptly named Chang’e 4, makes a special appearance when Fei Fei (spoiler alert) lands on the far side of the Moon. Chang’e 4 was preceded by Chang’e 1, 2, and 3 — with number 5 happening right now.
